# Graphics APIs

# [XPLMGraphics](/sdk/XPLMGraphics/)API

A few notes on coordinate systems:

X-Plane uses three kinds of coordinates. Global coordinates are specified as
latitude, longitude and elevation. This coordinate system never changes but is
not very precise.

OpenGL (or ‘local’) coordinates are cartesian and move with the aircraft. They
offer more precision and are used for 3-d OpenGL drawing. The X axis is aligned
east-west with positive X meaning east. The Y axis is aligned straight up and
down at the point 0,0,0 (but since the Earth is round it is not truly straight
up and down at other points). The Z axis is aligned north-south at 0, 0, 0 with
positive Z pointing south (but since the Earth is round it isn’t exactly
north-south as you move east or west of 0, 0, 0). One unit is one meter and the
point 0,0,0 is on the surface of the Earth at sea level for some latitude and
longitude picked by the sim such that the user’s aircraft is reasonably nearby.

2-d Panel coordinates are 2d, with the X axis horizontal and the Y axis
vertical. The point 0,0 is the bottom left and 1024,768 is the upper right of
the screen. This is true no matter what resolution the user’s monitor is in;
when running in higher resolution, graphics will be scaled.

Use X-Plane’s routines to convert between global and local coordinates. Do not
attempt to do this conversion yourself; the precise ‘roundness’ of X-Plane’s
physics model may not match your own, and (to make things weirder) the user can
potentially customize the physics of the current planet.

## X-PLANE GRAPHICS

These routines allow you to use OpenGL with X-Plane.

### [XPLMTextureID](/sdk/XPLMTextureID/)

XPLM Texture IDs name well-known textures in the sim for you to use. This allows
you to recycle textures from X-Plane, saving VRAM.

*Warning*: do not use these enums. The only remaining use they have is to access
the legacy compatibility v10 UI texture; if you need this, get it via the
Widgets library.

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [xplm_Tex_GeneralInterface](/sdk/xplm_Tex_GeneralInterface/) | "0" | The
bitmap that contains window outlines, button outlines, fonts, etc. |
| [xplm_Tex_AircraftPaint](/sdk/xplm_Tex_AircraftPaint/) | "1" | The exterior
paint for the user's aircraft (daytime). |
| [xplm_Tex_AircraftLiteMap](/sdk/xplm_Tex_AircraftLiteMap/) | "2" | The
exterior light map for the user's aircraft. |

### [XPLMSetGraphicsState](/sdk/XPLMSetGraphicsState/)

```cpp
XPLM_API void       XPLMSetGraphicsState(
                         int                  inEnableFog,
                         int                  inNumberTexUnits,
                         int                  inEnableLighting,
                         int                  inEnableAlphaTesting,
                         int                  inEnableAlphaBlending,
                         int                  inEnableDepthTesting,
                         int                  inEnableDepthWriting);

```

[XPLMSetGraphicsState](/sdk/XPLMSetGraphicsState/)changes OpenGL’s fixed
function pipeline state. You are not responsible for restoring any state that is
accessed via[XPLMSetGraphicsState](/sdk/XPLMSetGraphicsState/), but you are
responsible for not accessing this state directly.

- inEnableFog - enables or disables fog, equivalent to: glEnable(GL_FOG);
- inNumberTexUnits - enables or disables a number of multitexturing units. If the number is 0, 2d texturing is disabled entirely, as in glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D); Otherwise, 2d texturing is enabled, and a number of multitexturing units are enabled sequentially, starting with unit 0, e.g. glActiveTextureARB(GL_TEXTURE0_ARB); glEnable (GL_TEXTURE_2D);
- inEnableLighting - enables or disables OpenGL lighting, e.g. glEnable(GL_LIGHTING); glEnable(GL_LIGHT0);
- inEnableAlphaTesting - enables or disables the alpha test per pixel, e.g. glEnable(GL_ALPHA_TEST);
- inEnableAlphaBlending - enables or disables alpha blending per pixel, e.g. glEnable(GL_BLEND);
- inEnableDepthTesting - enables per pixel depth testing, as in glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);
- inEnableDepthWriting - enables writing back of depth information to the depth buffer, as in glDepthMask(GL_TRUE);

The purpose of this function is to change OpenGL state while keeping X-Plane
aware of the state changes; this keeps X-Plane from getting surprised by OGL
state changes, and prevents X-Plane and plug-ins from having to set all state
before all draws;[XPLMSetGraphicsState](/sdk/XPLMSetGraphicsState/)internally
skips calls to change state that is already properly enabled.

X-Plane does not have a ‘default’ OGL state for plug-ins with respect to the
above state vector; plug-ins should totally set OGL state using this API before
drawing. Use[XPLMSetGraphicsState](/sdk/XPLMSetGraphicsState/)instead of any of
the above OpenGL calls.

WARNING: Any routine that performs drawing
(e.g.[XPLMDrawString](/sdk/XPLMDrawString/)or widget code) may change X-Plane’s
state. Always set state before drawing after unknown code has executed.

*Deprecation Warnings*: X-Plane’s lighting and fog environment is significantly
more complex than the fixed function pipeline can express; do not assume that
lighting and fog state is a good approximation for 3-d drawing. Prefer to use
XPLMInstancing to draw objects. All calls
to[XPLMSetGraphicsState](/sdk/XPLMSetGraphicsState/)should have no fog or
lighting.

### [XPLMBindTexture2d](/sdk/XPLMBindTexture2d/)

```cpp
XPLM_API void       XPLMBindTexture2d(
                         int                  inTextureNum,
                         int                  inTextureUnit);

```

[XPLMBindTexture2d](/sdk/XPLMBindTexture2d/)changes what texture is bound to the
2d texturing target. This routine caches the current 2d texture across all
texturing units in the sim and plug-ins, preventing extraneous binding. For
example, consider several plug-ins running in series; if they all use the
‘general interface’ bitmap to do UI, calling this function will skip the
rebinding of the general interface texture on all but the first plug-in, which
can provide better frame rates on some graphics cards.

inTextureID is the ID of the texture object to bind; inTextureUnit is a
zero-based texture unit (e.g. 0 for the first one), up to a maximum of 4 units.
(This number may increase in future versions of X-Plane.)

Use this routine instead of glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, ….);

### [XPLMGenerateTextureNumbers](/sdk/XPLMGenerateTextureNumbers/)

```cpp
XPLM_API void       XPLMGenerateTextureNumbers(
                         int *                outTextureIDs,
                         int                  inCount);

```

Use this routine instead of glGenTextures to generate new texture object IDs.
This routine historically ensured that plugins don’t use texure IDs that X-Plane
is reserving for its own use.

### [XPLMGetTexture](/sdk/XPLMGetTexture/)

```cpp
XPLM_API int        XPLMGetTexture(
                         XPLMTextureID        inTexture);

```

[XPLMGetTexture](/sdk/XPLMGetTexture/)returns the OpenGL texture ID of an
X-Plane texture based on a generic identifying code. For example, you can get
the texture for X-Plane’s UI bitmaps.

### [XPLMWorldToLocal](/sdk/XPLMWorldToLocal/)

```cpp
XPLM_API void       XPLMWorldToLocal(
                         double               inLatitude,
                         double               inLongitude,
                         double               inAltitude,
                         double *             outX,
                         double *             outY,
                         double *             outZ);

```

This routine translates coordinates from latitude, longitude, and altitude to
local scene coordinates. Latitude and longitude are in decimal degrees, and
altitude is in meters MSL (mean sea level). The XYZ coordinates are in meters in
the local OpenGL coordinate system.

### [XPLMLocalToWorld](/sdk/XPLMLocalToWorld/)

```cpp
XPLM_API void       XPLMLocalToWorld(
                         double               inX,
                         double               inY,
                         double               inZ,
                         double *             outLatitude,
                         double *             outLongitude,
                         double *             outAltitude);

```

This routine translates a local coordinate triplet back into latitude,
longitude, and altitude. Latitude and longitude are in decimal degrees, and
altitude is in meters MSL (mean sea level). The XYZ coordinates are in meters in
the local OpenGL coordinate system.

NOTE: world coordinates are less precise than local coordinates; you should try
to avoid round tripping from local to world and back.

### [XPLMDrawTranslucentDarkBox](/sdk/XPLMDrawTranslucentDarkBox/)

```cpp
XPLM_API void       XPLMDrawTranslucentDarkBox(
                         int                  inLeft,
                         int                  inTop,
                         int                  inRight,
                         int                  inBottom);

```

This routine draws a translucent dark box, partially obscuring parts of the
screen but making text easy to read. This is the same graphics primitive used by
X-Plane to show text files.

## X-PLANE TEXT

### [XPLMFontID](/sdk/XPLMFontID/)

X-Plane features some fixed-character fonts. Each font may have its own metrics.

WARNING: Some of these fonts are no longer supported or may have changed
geometries. For maximum copmatibility, see the comments below.

Note: X-Plane 7 supports proportional-spaced fonts. Since no measuring routine
is available yet, the SDK will normally draw using a fixed-width font. You can
use a dataref to enable proportional font drawing on XP7 if you want to.

### [XPLMDrawString](/sdk/XPLMDrawString/)

```cpp
XPLM_API void       XPLMDrawString(
                         float *              inColorRGB,
                         int                  inXOffset,
                         int                  inYOffset,
                         const char *         inChar,
                         int *                inWordWrapWidth,    /* Can be NULL */
                         XPLMFontID           inFontID);

```

This routine draws a NULL terminated string in a given font. Pass in the lower
left pixel that the character is to be drawn onto. Also pass the character and
font ID. This function returns the x offset plus the width of all drawn
characters. The color to draw in is specified as a pointer to an array of three
floating point colors, representing RGB intensities from 0.0 to 1.0.

### [XPLMDrawNumber](/sdk/XPLMDrawNumber/)

```cpp
XPLM_API void       XPLMDrawNumber(
                         float *              inColorRGB,
                         int                  inXOffset,
                         int                  inYOffset,
                         double               inValue,
                         int                  inDigits,
                         int                  inDecimals,
                         int                  inShowSign,
                         XPLMFontID           inFontID);

```

This routine draws a number similar to the digit editing fields in PlaneMaker
and data output display in X-Plane. Pass in a color, a position, a floating
point value, and formatting info. Specify how many integer and how many decimal
digits to show and whether to show a sign, as well as a character set. This
routine returns the xOffset plus width of the string drawn.

### [XPLMGetFontDimensions](/sdk/XPLMGetFontDimensions/)

```cpp
XPLM_API void       XPLMGetFontDimensions(
                         XPLMFontID           inFontID,
                         int *                outCharWidth,    /* Can be NULL */
                         int *                outCharHeight,    /* Can be NULL */
                         int *                outDigitsOnly);    /* Can be NULL */

```

This routine returns the width and height of a character in a given font. It
also tells you if the font only supports numeric digits. Pass NULL if you don’t
need a given field. Note that for a proportional font the width will be an
arbitrary, hopefully average width.

### [XPLMMeasureString](/sdk/XPLMMeasureString/)

```cpp
XPLM_API float      XPLMMeasureString(
                         XPLMFontID           inFontID,
                         const char *         inChar,
                         int                  inNumChars);

```

This routine returns the width in pixels of a string using a given font. The
string is passed as a pointer plus length (and does not need to be null
terminated); this is used to allow for measuring substrings. The return value is
floating point; it is possible that future font drawing may allow for fractional
pixels.
